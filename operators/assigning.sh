# Tutorial: assigning operators
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assignment is a bit same as a box where you store something
# the "box" is called a variable, and to store something, you put what you want
# at the right of an equal and at the left, the name of the variable

# Example
fruit="banana"

# be careful, no spaces

# we can see the result here
echo "The value of \"fruit\" is $fruit."
